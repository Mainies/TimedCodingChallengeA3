# TimedCodingChallengeA3

This challenge was part of a short term (1-week) release. The assignment involved being able to handle command line inputs and 
print formatting in a way that matched the assignment specification. 

The assignment required program design using Object Oriented paradigm. The program is required to be able to run 
on the following:

1. my_record.py
2. my_record.py results.txt
3. my_record.py result.txt datasets.txt
4. my_record.py results.txt datasets.txt algorithms.txt

Note that results, datasets and algorithms may have different names. There was some requirement to handle exceptions but the order of inputted
files always remains as results, datasets and algorithms and those files maintain the same structure.
